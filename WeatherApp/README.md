To create a weather application in Python, you will need to use an API that provides weather data. One popular API for this purpose is OpenWeatherMap. To use this program, you'll need to sign up for an API key at the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a city name. It will then make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name and your API key. The weather data is retrieved and displayed, including the weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Feel free to modify and enhance this program as per your requirements. You can incorporate additional features like a forecast for multiple days, user-friendly error handling, or a graphical user interface to enhance the user experience.

This code first imports the requests and json modules. Then, it defines a function called get_weather() that takes a city name as input and returns the weather data for that city. The function makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API and parses the response JSON data.

The main() function prompts the user to enter a city name and then calls the get_weather() function. If the weather data is found, it prints out the current weather conditions and forecast. Otherwise, it prints a message saying that no weather data was found.

To run this code, you will need to install the requests and json modules. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:pip install requests json

Once you have installed the modules, you can run the code by saving it as a .py file and then running it from the command line:python weather_app.py
Enter a city name and the code will print out the current weather conditions and forecast for that city.
