In this program, the Question class represents a single quiz question. It has attributes for the question text, a list of choices, and the correct answer. The check_answer() method checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer.

The Quiz class manages a collection of questions and keeps track of the user's score. It has methods to add questions to the quiz and run the quiz. The run_quiz() method iterates through each question, presents it to the user along with the choices, prompts for an answer, checks if the answer is correct, and updates the score accordingly.

To use the program, you can create instances of the Question class with the appropriate question text, choices, and correct answer. Then, create an instance of the Quiz class, add the questions to the quiz, and finally, run the quiz using the run_quiz() method.

You can expand upon this program by adding more questions, implementing a leaderboard to track high scores, or incorporating additional features to enhance the user experience
