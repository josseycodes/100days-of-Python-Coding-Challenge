Here, we import the necessary libraries: requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content, and matplotlib.pyplot for creating visualizations.We define the URL of the website we want to scrape (replace with the actual URL). Then, we use the requests.get() function to send an HTTP GET request to that URL and retrieve the webpage's content. We create a BeautifulSoup object named soup by passing the response content and specifying the parser as "html.parser"

We use BeautifulSoup's .find_all() method to locate all <span> elements with the class name "temperature" (replace with the actual HTML tags and classes from the website you're scraping). This is where we expect to find the temperature data.
We initialize empty lists dates and temperatures to store the scraped data. Then, we iterate through the temperature_data list, extracting the date and temperature values. The get_text() method retrieves the text content within the <span> tag, and data["data-temperature"] accesses the value of the data-temperature attribute (replace with the actual attribute name from the website).
Finally, we use Matplotlib to create a bar chart. We set up the figure size, create a bar chart using plt.bar(), and customize the labels and title. The plt.xticks(rotation=45) line rotates the x-axis labels for better readability. plt.tight_layout() ensures that all elements fit within the figure. Finally, plt.show() displays the chart.
