Building a complete recipe finder application involves multiple components, including setting up the API or web scraping, handling user input, and displaying the results.
Please note that the API URL (https://example-recipe-api.com/recipes?ingredient={ingredient}) used in this example is fictional and doesn't exist. In a real-world scenario, you would need to replace it with a functional recipe API or implement web scraping techniques to retrieve recipe data.

Additionally, a complete application would involve handling more user interactions, error handling, and possibly a more sophisticated user interface. However, this simplified program demonstrates the core logic of a recipe finder application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients and dietary preferences.
