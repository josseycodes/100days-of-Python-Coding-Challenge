This code first imports the requests and json modules. Then, it defines a function called get_weather() that takes a city name as input and returns the weather data for that city. The function makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API and parses the response JSON data.

The main() function prompts the user to enter a city name and then calls the get_weather() function. If the weather data is found, it prints out the current weather conditions and forecast. Otherwise, it prints a message saying that no weather data was found.

To run this code, you will need to install the requests and json modules. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:pip install requests json

Once you have installed the modules, you can run the code by saving it as a .py file and then running it from the command line:python weather_app.py
Enter a city name and the code will print out the current weather conditions and forecast for that city.
