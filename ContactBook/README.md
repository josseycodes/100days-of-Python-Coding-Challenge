In this program, the contacts list is used to store contact information as dictionaries. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose options to add a contact, search for a contact by name, delete a contact by name, or exit the application.

The add_contact() function prompts the user for contact details, creates a dictionary with the contact information, and adds it to the contacts list.

The search_contact() function allows the user to search for a contact by name. It compares the search name with the names in the contacts list, performs a case-insensitive match, and displays the matching contacts' details if found.

The delete_contact() function prompts the user for a contact name to delete. If a contact with the matching name is found, it is removed from the contacts list.

The main() function acts as the program's entry point and displays the menu options. It calls the appropriate functions based on the user's choice.

Feel free to modify and enhance the program according to your specific requirements, such as adding additional fields to the contacts, implementing file-based storage, or incorporating more advanced search capabilities.
