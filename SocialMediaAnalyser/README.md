This program retrieves and displays basic data from Twitter using the Tweepy library and performs sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library.

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required libraries

pip install tweepy
pip install textblob

Replace YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET with your actual Twitter API credentials. Remember to create a Twitter Developer account and create an app to get these credentials.

This simplified example demonstrates how to retrieve tweets based on a keyword and perform basic sentiment analysis using TextBlob's polarity scoring. For a more comprehensive Social Media Analyzer, you would need to integrate with the specific social media APIs and implement more advanced data retrieval and analysis techniques.
