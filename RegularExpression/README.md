This program uses regular expressions to:

    Search for email addresses in the given text.
    Replace email addresses with "[EMAIL]" in the text.
    Extract domain names from email addresses.
    Check if the text starts with "This".
    Check if the word "contact" is present in the text.

You can modify and expand upon this code to perform various other text manipulation tasks using regular expressions in Python.
In Python, a regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," is a powerful and flexible tool for working with text. It is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regular expressions are used for various text processing tasks, such as searching, matching, and manipulating strings based on patterns.

Python provides the `re` module, which allows you to work with regular expressions. The `re` module provides functions and classes for working with regular expressions, including:

1. `re.search(pattern, string)`: Searches for a match of the pattern anywhere in the string and returns a match object if found.

2. `re.match(pattern, string)`: Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string and returns a match object if found.

3. `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.

4. `re.finditer(pattern, string)`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.

5. `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`: Replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement string.

6. `re.compile(pattern)`: Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regex object, which can be used for more efficient searching and matching if you need to apply the same pattern multiple times.

Regular expressions use special characters and syntax to define patterns. For example:

- `.` matches any character except a newline.
- `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
- `+` matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
- `?` matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
- `[]` defines a character class, allowing you to specify a set of characters to match.
- `()` groups expressions together.

For example, the pattern `r'\d+'` would match one or more digits in a string.

Regular expressions can be quite powerful for text processing tasks, but they can also be complex to write and understand. Therefore, it's important to practice and refer to regex documentation and tutorials to become proficient in using them effectively in Python.
