To create a simple e-commerce store in Python, we'll use basic data structures and functions. For this example, we won't be implementing a database, and we'll use a dictionary to represent the products available in the store.
This program will create a simple text-based e-commerce store. Users can display available products, add items to the cart, view their cart, and proceed to checkout. Note that this implementation does not handle edge cases or input validation thoroughly, as it aims to provide a basic understanding of the e-commerce flow. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to add more robust error handling and potentially implement a proper database to manage product information and user data.
