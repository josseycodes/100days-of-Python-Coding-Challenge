This is a Python program that uses the Pillow library for image processing. Make sure you have Pillow installed in your Python environment before running the code. This program loads an image of your choice, performs image resizing, cropping, and filtering, and saves the processed images to the specified output paths. Before running the code, make sure to replace the file paths with the actual path to the image you want to process. Adjust the parameters for resizing and cropping according to your requirements. After running the program, you'll find the resized, cropped, and filtered images saved in the specified output paths.
