step by step code explanation:

Import the Required Library: The code starts by importing the sqlite3 library, which allows Python to interact with SQLite databases.

Connect to the Database: The sqlite3.connect() function is used to connect to the SQLite database. If the database file doesn't exist, this call will create a new one. The connection is stored in the variable conn, which will be used to interact with the database.

Create a Table: The conn.execute() function is used to execute an SQL command that creates a table named "todos" to store our todo items. The table has three columns: id (auto-incrementing primary key), task (textual description of the todo task), and status (textual status of the task, e.g., "Complete" or "Incomplete"). The CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ensures that the table is created only if it doesn't already exist.

Define CRUD Functions: The code defines four functions to interact with the database:

a. add_todo_item(task, status): This function takes a task and status as input and inserts a new row into the "todos" table with the provided values using the INSERT INTO SQL command.

b. get_todo_items(): This function retrieves all the todo items from the "todos" table using the SELECT * FROM SQL command and returns them as a list of tuples.

c. update_todo_status(todo_id, new_status): This function updates the status of a todo item identified by todo_id with the new status provided as new_status. It uses the UPDATE SQL command.

d. delete_todo_item(todo_id): This function deletes the todo item with the specified todo_id from the "todos" table using the DELETE FROM SQL command.

Example Usage: In the __main__ block, the code demonstrates how to use the CRUD functions:

a. It adds a new todo item to the database using add_todo_item().

b. It retrieves all the todo items from the database using get_todo_items() and prints them.

c. It updates the status of a todo item using update_todo_status().

d. It deletes a todo item using delete_todo_item().

e. It retrieves the updated todo list and prints it.

Close the Database Connection: Finally, the code closes the connection to the database using conn.close().

This code provides a basic framework to create, read, update, and delete todo items from an SQLite database. In a real-world application, you would typically build a user interface to interact with these functions and handle user input, error handling, and data validation to create a complete todo list application.
