Here's a Python program that reads a text file, analyzes its content, and displays various information such as word count, character count, and most common words. Make sure to replace 'example.txt' with the actual path to your text file. When you run the program, it will read the file, perform the analysis, and display the word count, character count, and the most common words (change the number in most_common(5) to display a different number of common words).

Please note that the program assumes the file is a text file with readable content. It removes punctuation, converts the text to lowercase, and treats each word as a separate entity for analysis.
