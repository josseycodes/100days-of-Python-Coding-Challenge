Creating a fully functional chatbot requires more code than can be provided in a single response. However, this is a simplified example of a chatbot using Python's nltk library for natural language processing. Keep in mind that this is a basic illustration, and real-world chatbots can be more complex and sophisticated.

First, make sure you have the nltk library installed.
import nltk: Imports the nltk library, which stands for Natural Language Toolkit, used for natural language processing tasks.
import random: Imports the random module to generate random responses from the chatbot.
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections: Imports the Chat class and reflections dictionary from the nltk.chat.util module. The Chat class is used to create the chatbot, and reflections provides a mapping of pronouns for more human-like interactions.
pairs: A list of pattern-response pairs that define how the chatbot should respond to user inputs. Each pair consists of a regular expression pattern (the user's input) and a list of possible responses.
def chatbot():: Defines a function named chatbot to encapsulate the chatbot's behavior.
print("Hello! I'm your chatbot. Type 'quit' to exit."): Displays an introductory message to the user.
chat = Chat(pairs, reflections): Creates an instance of the Chat class, passing the pairs list and reflections dictionary as arguments.
chat.converse(): Initiates a conversation loop where the chatbot interacts with the user based on the defined patterns and responses.
if __name__ == "__main__":: Checks if the script is being run as the main program.
nltk.download("punkt"): Downloads the punkt tokenizer data from nltk if it hasn't been downloaded already. This data is used for tokenization in natural language processing.
chatbot(): Calls the chatbot function to start the chatbot interaction.
Overall, this code creates a basic chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined patterns. It introduces the chatbot, provides responses to specific queries, and allows the user to exit the conversation by typing "quit." Keep in mind that this is a simple example, and real-world chatbots involve more sophisticated natural language processing techniques and responses.
